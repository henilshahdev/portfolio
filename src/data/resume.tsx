		"At the beginning of 2023, I transitioned from my role as a Software Engineer (Frontend Focused) at a startup, where I had the opportunity to work on innovative projects. Since then, I've embraced a new challenge as a Web Development Instructor, teaching and mentoring over 40 aspiring students across Canada. My background includes a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a major in Information Technology. I am passionate about exploring new tools and technologies, often diving in just for funâ€”even if it means encountering a few unexpected bugs along the way. During weekends, I love working on side projects that keep my skills sharp and my creativity flowing.",
